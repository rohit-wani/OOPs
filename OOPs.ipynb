        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "-  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which are instances of classes. It is designed to model real-world entities and their interactions by bundling data and behavior together.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "-  In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (behavior) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "-  In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity that has:\n",
        "\n",
        "Attributes (data/properties)\n",
        "\n",
        "Methods (functions/behaviors)\n",
        "\n",
        "An object is created based on a class and contains actual values instead of placeholders.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "-  Abstraction hides complex implementation and shows only essential features to the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Encapsulation hides the internal state of an object and restricts direct access to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "-  Dunder methods in Python (short for \"double underscore\" methods) are special methods with names that start and end with double underscores, like __init__, __str__, __len__, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "-  Inheritance is a core concept in OOP that allows a class (child or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent or superclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "-  Polymorphism means \"many forms\" — it allows objects of different classes to be treated through a common interface, typically by using methods with the same name but different behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "-  Encapsulation in Python is achieved by:\n",
        "\n",
        "Bundling data (attributes) and methods inside a class\n",
        "\n",
        "Controlling access to that data using access modifiers\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "-  A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize a newly created object.\n",
        "In Python, the constructor method is named __init__().\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "-   Class methods take cls as the first parameter and can access/modify class state.\n",
        "Static methods don’t take self or cls and act like regular functions inside the class namespace.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "-   In Python, method overloading (having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters) is not directly supported like in some other languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "-   Method overriding in OOP is when a subclass provides its own version of a method that is already defined in its parent class, allowing the subclass to modify or extend the behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "-   The @property decorator in Python is used to define a method that behaves like an attribute — allowing you to access a method like a regular attribute without parentheses.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "-   Polymorphism is important in OOP because it enables flexible and reusable code by allowing different objects to be treated through a common interface, letting methods behave differently based on the object’s class. This simplifies code maintenance, enhances scalability, and supports dynamic method binding.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "-   An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be a base class for other classes. It typically contains one or more abstract methods—methods declared but without implementation—that must be overridden by subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "-   Modularity — Code is organized into reusable objects, making it easier to manage and update.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reusability — Inheritance allows new classes to reuse existing code, reducing redundancy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scalability — OOP makes it easier to scale and extend programs with new features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Maintainability — Encapsulation hides internal details, simplifying debugging and updates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flexibility — Polymorphism enables using a single interface for different data types or classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Real-world Modeling — Objects represent real-world entities, making designs intuitive and clear.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "-   Class variable is shared by all instances of the class — there’s only one copy, defined at the class level.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance variable is unique to each object — each instance has its own separate copy\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "-   Multiple inheritance in Python is when a class inherits from more than one parent class at the same time, allowing it to combine behaviors and attributes from all those parents.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "-   Great question! Both __str__ and __repr__ are special dunder methods in Python used to define how objects are represented as strings, but they serve slightly different purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "-   Both __str__ and __repr__ are special dunder methods in Python used to define how objects are represented as strings, but they serve slightly different purposes:\n",
        "__repr__\n",
        "Intended to provide an official, unambiguous string representation of the object, ideally one that could be used to recreate the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Used mainly for debugging and development.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you print a list of objects, Python calls each object's __repr__.\n",
        "\n",
        "__str__\n",
        "Intended to provide a readable, user-friendly string representation of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Used by the print() function and str() constructor.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "-   The __del__ method in Python is a destructor—a special method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., when its reference count drops to zero and it’s garbage collected).\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "-   @staticmethod defines a method that doesn’t access the class or instance and acts like a regular function inside a class.\n",
        "@classmethod takes the class (cls) as the first argument and can access or modify class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "-   In Python, polymorphism allows methods in different classes related by inheritance to have the same name but behave differently. When you call a method on an object, Python uses the actual object's class method (not the parent’s), enabling dynamic method overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "-   Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single line because each method returns the object itself (self). This allows for concise and readable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "-   The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. When you define __call__ in a class, you can use its objects with parentheses () and pass arguments, triggering the __call__ method.\n"
